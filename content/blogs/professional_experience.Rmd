## University Education

For my undergraduate studies, I pursued the degree program BSc International 
Business at Maastricht University. Following this general management degree for 
Bachelors, I decided to pursue a more specailized finance degree for my Masters, 
which lead me to join the Masters in Financial Anlaysis at London Business
School.

I built my interest in finance throughout several finance courses at Maastricht 
University, for example Corporate Finance, Finance and Accounting and Investment 
Analysis and Portfolio Management. In addition, I seeked out additional sources 
of information to broaden my knowledge about finance, for example as an active
member of the association Sigma Finance. To confirm this interest in finance and 
to gain practical insights, I completed internships in several areas of the 
financial sector.
