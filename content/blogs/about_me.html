<h3>What is your favorite trip of all time?</h3>
<p>My favorite trip of all time was my travel to Sri Lanka. Three aspects contributed
to this memorable trip. Firstly, the versatility of the countryâ€™s nature, ranging
from beaches over tea plantations to mountains. Secondly, I was fascinated by the
traditional healing methods (Ayuveda), products and rituals.</p>
